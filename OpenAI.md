# OpenAI

OpenAI is a research organization and technology company that focuses on artificial intelligence (AI).It was founded in December 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, Wojciech Zaremba, and John Schulman. The idea emerged from a growing concern about the potential risks associated with artificial intelligence (AI) as it becomes more advanced. Musk and others worried about the potential for AI to outpace human intelligence and potentially pose risks to humanity if not properly controlled.Their vision was to create a research organization that would advance AI in a way that benefits all of humanity, while also ensuring that AI systems are developed safely and ethically. OpenAI's mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity and to develop and promote friendly AI for the long-term benefit of society.The founders recognized the need for collaboration and transparency in AI research, hence the name "OpenAI," reflecting their commitment to openness and accessibility in their work. Since its inception, OpenAI has been involved in groundbreaking research in AI, developing state-of-the-art models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and working on various projects to advance the field while considering ethical implicationsOpenAI officially began its operations in December 2015 when it was founded. Initially, it was funded by a group of high-profile tech entrepreneurs and investors, including Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Peter Thiel, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Greg Brockman, and Amazon Web Services.The initial funding allowed OpenAI to start its research and development efforts, focusing on advancing artificial intelligence while also prioritizing safety and ethical considerations. Over the years, OpenAI has continued to receive funding from various sources, including philanthropic organizations, corporate partnerships, government grants, and individual donations.OpenAI has also pursued partnerships with companies like Microsoft, which has provided significant financial support and resources for research collaboration.
